I have experience in Power BI and knowledge about creating reports, dashboards, data models, DAX, Power Query, and more.

However, in my current job, I am using a Linux operating system, which makes it impossible to use Power BI Desktop.
I tried using Power BI Services, but it is very limited to just loading data, a few transformations, and visualization, 
so I am unable to create tables, new columns, or measures. I attempted to install VirtualBox but encountered some issues, 
so I’ve decided to describe what I would use for this type of data and visualizations.

For Sales by Category, I would use a stacked bar chart or a donut chart if there are few categories to show the 100% proportion, 
with filters for date and region.

For Sales by Region, I would use a bubble map filtered by date, category, and regions with low granularity.

For Monthly Sales Comparison, I would use a data table with the following columns (Year, Month, Sales, Last Month’s Sales, % Change), 
filtered by date, category, region, and product.

I also have experience with Tableau and Qlik, but I feel more comfortable with Power BI.
